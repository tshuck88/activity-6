    <h1> Welcome to a web page about elephants!</h1>
    <p>Elephants, the largest existing land animals, are mammals of the family Elephantidae. Three species are currently
        recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Elephantidae is the
        only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; extinct members include the mastodons. The family Elephantidae
        also contains several now-extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked elephants. African
        elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level
        backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and
        tough but sensitive skin. The trunk, also called a proboscis, is used for breathing, bringing food and water to
        the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as
        tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as
        well as in communication. The pillar-like legs carry their great weight.

        Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different
        habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes. They are herbivorous, and they stay near water
        when it is accessible. They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments.
        Other animals tend to keep their distance from elephants; the exception is their predators such as lions,
        tigers, hyenas, and wild dogs, which usually target only young elephants (calves). Elephants have a
        fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females (cows) tend to live
        in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The
        groups, which do not include bulls, are led by the (usually) oldest cow, known as the matriarch.
